        <p> The media usage of 26 classmates was analyzed using what was presented on their personal web-pages. (One link was broken out
          of the original 27.) I have compiled the list of all names and general interests into a google slides document
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14hA4qRaF2YWdi50oITnN-Okg7FnhIhdK4YbMCL13-UE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">

            It contains broad categories for more specific services or media. Categories include Music Streaming, Music Genre, Social Media, Video Streaming,
            Applications, Video Games, Messaging, and Other.

          In sheet 2 of the google I marked key terms used in the student's reasoning for taking the course. I've counted the number of times each
          general reason was used, but have not identified which student specifically used that reason. It was interesting to see why someone might be interested in a specific class.

      <p>I counted general terms and reasons that students stated to justify them taking the course. Aside from the typical "to learn more" answer that could be applicable to any class,
      many were interested in learning of new interactive technologies (or found these new technologies interesting / intriguing). Many found the topics interesting, and roughly 1/5 of the class
    was interested in using the knowledge from this course in a future career or project. It was also fun to see a couple of people stating something along the lines of "I just needed this
    credit to gradutate".</p>

      <p> As stated above, I listed out student names and linked their interest and service use to other students who use the same content. By laying out the data like this, I was able to get a
        count of how many students listed each service or media respsectively.

      <p> The first assignment for this course asked students what types and forms of media they interact with. While this allowed for many types to be labelled
        on their site, it didn't provide ideal structure for getting complete data on every student. A student could have left off something that they actually do use.
        For example, when stating that they listen to music they could have left off what streaming service or physical medium that they listen to the music off of. So while
        the data isn't comprehensive, it can easily show what generally is the most popular media for the group.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p> The majority of the media described and listed is possible due to technology that has been created in the past 20-25 years. Outliers include books ("Other") and radio.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Internet-based media include music / video streaming services, social medias, and messaging / email services. Technologies implented within the last decade may include HD video Streaming
        services, complex social networks, and some of the video games listed.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It is interesting to see which media services the majority of the group have or use. Things like YouTube and Instagram are very common, while more niche platforms are evenly distributed
        but less common. Everyone had an option for video and messaging, they're choice in primary service just differed.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Video games were a common listing. While almost half of the group played some sort of game (and I'm sure the list would be higher if including mobile games), not many played the
        same game. ~Perhaps this list could be used to form some groups for those games.~ Many of the games listed have large communities with high active player counts, with several of the games exsiting
        for 5+ years. It could be shown that these games may bleed into other categories through their messaging and social community aspects.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        While the distribution of ideas through media may not change at its core, the avenues through which these ideas are explored is ever changing. Ultimately, these continually new and ever-changing avenues
        reflect their user-base of the same nature.
